# Close left tabs (white icon)
This is a forked version of [CloseLeftTabs](https://github.com/Zohaib-Amir/CloseLeftTabs) Chrome Extension to close all left tabs on one click.
The difference with the original is just adding a white icon because this makes easier to find in a darker color theme for Chrome.
